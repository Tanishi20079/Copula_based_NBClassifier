# Empirical Copula based Naive Bayes Classifier


Developed a new rank-based classifier with the help of Empirical Copula and Existing naive Bayes classifier. We propose a Bayesian model with enhanced performance on statistical datasets by incorporating the concept of Empirical copulas to compute the joint probability distribution of features present in the data. Copulas are cumulative distribution functions known to be popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they easily enable one to model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating the marginals and copulae separately. The key idea is to replace the joint probability, which is the probability of occurrence of two or more simultaneous events, with the cumulative distribution generated by the non-parametric empirical copula function and utilize it on bivariate and multivariate data to assess the performance of the model thus generated. Through extensive research on the topic of non-parametric empirical copulas and tuning the model with various smoothing techniques, we have achieved significant accuracy with a stronger statistical hold in predictive analysis of different datasets in comparison to the simple Gaussian Naive Bayes technique.
